# Star Wars

I wrote this code as a hack week project to learn how to use the Arduino board and implement basic concurrency.

It will play the Star Wars Imperial March tune on the passive buzzer and, simultaneously, it will run the opening crawl from Star Wars: Episode IV â€“ A New Hope on a Hitachi HD44780 compatible LCD.
